## MintConfig
First I want to explain, why I choose this Distro/Desktop and why it might be just the Linux Distro for you.
For my Desktop-PC, i wanted a stable Distrobution (I use Arch btw on my Laptop), which is why i settled for Linux Mint (also Cinnamon 
is just such a comfortable experience).

Now, in the following lines i will explain, how i made my Desktop look, how it looks (xD).
