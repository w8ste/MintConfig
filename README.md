# MintConfig
First I want to explain, why I choose this Distro/Desktop and why it might be just the Linux Distro for you.
For my Desktop-PC, i wanted a stable Distrobution (I use Arch btw on my Laptop) and i believe 
that Fedora and my NVIDEA GPU might not become the best friends, which is why i settled for Linux Mint.

Now, in the following lines i will explain, how i made my Desktop look how it looks (xD).
